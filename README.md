Introduction

I am a Systems Administrator with experience supporting DoD environments and a strong interest in cybersecurity. I have hands-on experience with system administration, log analysis, virtualization labs, and automation using scripting tools. I am actively working toward transitioning into a Security Operations Center (SOC) role.

Objective

Seeking a SOC Tier 1 / Cybersecurity Analyst role to leverage my experience in system administration, log analysis, and security tooling. I aim to contribute to threat detection, incident response, and automation initiatives while further developing advanced SOC operational expertise.
